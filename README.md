# StickyHeader
It was done mainly because almost all popular libraries for sticky headers are too complex or offer a lot more features than needed. Some of them also breaks DiffUtils. For performance reason a header view is created only once. View types are not supported.
However, you can customize this view via supplied adapter when a sticky header replaces the previous one.

Usage
-----

1. Add jcenter() to repositories block in your gradle file.
2. Add `implementation 'com.shuhart.stickyheader:stickyheader:1.0'` to your dependencies.
3. Look into the sample for additional details on how to use and configure the library.

You should provide an adapter that extends [StickyAdapter](https://github.com/shuhart/StickyHeader/blob/master/stickyheader/src/main/java/com/shuhart/stickyheader/StickyAdapter.java) to the StickyHeaderItemDecorator that is used to create and bind sticky headers.


After that just attach it to the RecyclerView:

```java
StickyHeaderItemDecorator decorator = new StickyHeaderItemDecorator(adapter);
decorator.attachToRecyclerView(recyclerView);
```
